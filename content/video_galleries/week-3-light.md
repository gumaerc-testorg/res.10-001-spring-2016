The Greek roots of the word photography are "photos" (meaning light) and "graphé" (meaning drawing). Taken together photography means "drawing with light." In this week, we will investigate light.

## Topics

Observe difference between various light sources (LED, tungsten, fluorescent, available light) as well as the effect of bounced light, shadows, and reflective / transmitted light.

## What You’ll Need

- SLR camera with interchangeable lens capacity
- 105 macro lens
- Tripod
- Your camera's software and cable to view images on your computer
- An additional lighting source

## Assignment

- Find an image of a small object (in a magazine or online), scan or clip the image, use drawing tools to indicate on the image where you think the light sources are positioned.
- Take an image of your object in daylight and label it image 1. Then add a secondary light source and label it image 2.
- Comment on them. Your comments should:
    - Describe the differences
    - Indicate where the shadow(s) lie
    - Make a determination which image is more effective and explain why

### Optional Assignments

Take an image of your object with a direct light source and then use a white card to bounce the light (remember to keep exposure accurate) and take another image.

Think creatively about an unusual lighting method to photograph your object and take a picture. How did the unusual light source impact the photo? Did you learn anything about lighting?
